# Github Trends

This script finds 20 the most rated repositories on GitHub, which were created in the last 7 days,
and prints amount of open issues for them.

# How to run

Python 3 should be already installed. 
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3

Then run
C:\9_github_trending>python github_trending.py
```

It is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
